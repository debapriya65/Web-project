# Web-project
## Introduction

This repository contains a web project with two distinct applications: the "Bank App" and the "Ecommerce App." The Bank App allows users to manage their bank accounts, check balances, and view transaction histories. The Ecommerce App enables users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and make payments using their bank account credentials. Below, you'll find instructions on how to run each application.
